## Description:

A pure CSS illustration of stars, randombly generated using SCSS loops, variables, and methods.

## Tech:

Pug | SCSS

## About this Project:

This particular project was created as a way of practicing how to utilize loops, variables, and built in functions, such as random(), in SCSS.

While the output may not look like much, it's a stripped down and focused example of a few of the many things you can do with SCSS.
